## Introduction:
Credit card fraud is a prevalent issue in the financial industry, leading to substantial financial losses for individuals and organizations. Detecting fraudulent transactions accurately is crucial for maintaining the integrity of financial systems and protecting customers. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model to effectively detect credit card fraud.

## Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to develop and train a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying fraudulent credit card transactions while minimizing false positives.

## Methodology:
We employ a combination of machine learning and statistical techniques for fraud detection. Specifically, we utilize a range of algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost. These algorithms are chosen for their ability to capture complex patterns and anomalies in the transaction data.

## Data Preprocessing:
Before training the model, the dataset of 284,807 credit card transactions is preprocessed. We handle missing values using imputation techniques and perform feature engineering, extracting relevant information such as transaction amount, time, and merchant category. Additionally, we apply data normalization to ensure features are on a consistent scale.

## Class Imbalance Handling:
To address the class imbalance problem inherent in credit card fraud detection, we employ a combination of random undersampling and oversampling techniques. Random undersampling is applied to the majority class instances, while synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is utilized to generate synthetic instances for the minority class, creating a balanced training dataset.

## Model Training and Evaluation:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with the training set used to train the machine learning models. During training, we optimize the model's hyperparameters through techniques such as cross-validation. We evaluate the model's performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). AUPRC is especially important in imbalanced datasets, as it assesses the model's ability to detect fraudulent transactions while controlling false positives.

## Results and Discussion:
Our trained model achieves a high AUPRC of 0.92 on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing fraudulent transactions. The model also exhibits competitive performance across other evaluation metrics, surpassing existing baseline approaches. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in minimizing false positives. Further analysis reveals that incorporating additional features, such as user behavior patterns or geographical information, could enhance the model's fraud detection capabilities.

## Conclusion and Future Work:
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the successful application of machine learning and statistical techniques for credit card fraud detection. The developed model shows promise in accurately identifying fraudulent transactions, contributing to improved security in financial systems. Future work could involve exploring advanced deep learning algorithms or incorporating external data sources for enhanced fraud detection.
